    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "### 1. Noise Removal\n",
    "Fast Fourier Transform to convert from time domain into the frequency domain. <br/>\n",
    "Let x[n], 0<=n<= N-1, represent the PPG, and the FTT of x[n] is denoted as X[k], 0<=k<=N-1. The frquency components that are lower than 0 Hz or higher than 8 Hz are removed (to reduce noise and baseline wandering) by the following:  Xr[k] = X[k] where k>= 8; 0 otherwise. <br/>\n",
    "<br/>Inverse FFT (IFFT) to restore the PPG data to the time domain\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Normalization - 1st/2nd Derivative Calculations\n",
    "Every segment is normalized (between [0 1] using x'=(x-Xm)/(XM-Xm) where x is the data point, Xm is the min, and XM is the max.<br/>\n",
    "The 1st (dPPG) and 2nd (sdPPG) derivatives are then calculated.\n",

    "<br/>The following points should be labeled/extracted from the PPG/dPPG/sdPPG:<br/>\n",
    "    a. systolic peaks of PPG<br/>\n",
    "    b. onset and offset valley points of PPG by finding the min between 2 consecutive systolic peaks<br/>\n",
    "    c. locations with maximal and minimal slope values of PPG and dPPG by computing the gradients of the valley points<br/>\n",
    "    d. dicrotic notch points from secondary peaks of sdPPG contour\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 4. Data Partioning\n",
    "Each PPG data segment and its corresponding dPPG and sdPPG waves are partitioned into fragements by reserving each PPG data segment from one valley point of the PPG to the next consecutive valley point. <br/>\n",
